# CS2310_Course_Project
This project presents a modular hardware implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using Verilog HDL. The design models a 3x3 grid using individual TCell modules, each capable of storing the validity and symbol (X or O) of a move. User inputs are provided in the form of 2-bit row and column indices, which are decoded into a one-hot 9-bit signal using the RowColDecoder module to identify the selected cell. The TBox module serves as the top-level integrator, coordinating move registration, cell validation, and game logic. The check_winner module continuously monitors the grid to determine the current game state, outputting whether the game is ongoing, won by either player, or drawn. The design ensures that invalid overwrites are prevented and provides a reset mechanism to restart the game
